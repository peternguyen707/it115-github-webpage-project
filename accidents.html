       <h2 class="subheader">Self-Driving Cars</h2>
       
       
      <p> Although autonomous vehicles have already been able to hit the road, they aren’t exactly a common existence on the roads we commonly traverse. Within the past few years that have led up towards today, the development of autonomous vehicles have faced several technological and legal obstacles. These obstacles have discouraged the development of autonomous vehicles, thus hindering progress.</p>
    
       <p> Self-driving cars have a higher rate of accidents compared to human-driven cars, but the injuries are less serious.<br> </p>

       <p> On average, there are 9.1 self-driving car accidents per million miles driven, while the same rate is 4.1 crashes per million miles for regular vehicles. <br> </p>

       <p> For instance,there have been two pedestrian fatalities. One was caused by an Uber vehicle, and the other by a Tesla AV. Additionally, four AV drivers died in self-driving car accidents. (carsurance.net). No matter how advanced technology is used, there’s always a high possibility of self driving cars making mistakes. From the above example, we can illustrate that self-driving cars might bring more danger than their benefit. 
    <p> Accidents between 2016 and 2019 involving Tesla vehicles, and an accident involving an UBER vehicle and a pedestrian, “led to many other automated vehicle suppliers to suspend or completely abandon their own development plans” (Morningstar 2021)</p>
