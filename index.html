       With the development of autonomous vehicles over the course of history, jobs have been impacted in a number of ways, whether it be the creation,
       deprivation, or alteration of various jobs. Since the early 1900â€™s, positions have naturally been created towards the efforts of engineering
       autonomous vehicles. <br><br>
        
       Over recent years, the rate of engineering jobs involving autonomous vehicles has increased. Despite this increase in engineering jobs, 
       there are jobs that people will lose access to as development advances, such as truck-driving. <br><br> 
        
       With the development of autonomous vehicles comes several technological and legal obstacles, which have resulted in numerous accidents during implementation.
       People may not see these vehicles become commonplace before 2045. Nevertheless, development of autonomous vehicles continues, with the 
       creation, deprivation, and alteration of jobs as a natural occurrence towards development efforts.
